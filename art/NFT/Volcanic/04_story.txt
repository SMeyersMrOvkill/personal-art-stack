Mount Bloom #4 - TechnoCano

In a galaxy where the human race has finally solved the problems of space travel, we finally had the resources to master the art of geothermal energy. In this ( admittedly unlikely ) future, the universe is less an infinite map of points of light, and more a detailed 3D map of our neighbors. In this map, each inhabited planet is a mere coin in your display. This one, TechoCano, is known specifically for their volcanic energy harvesting medium. The whole planet, once deemed a wasteland suitable only for mining, has been transformed into an urban oasis of perfectly clear glass and steel so bright it hurts your eyes in the midday sun. Don't let that deter you, humans here experience a level of civility and material comfort unheard of in most human outposts. More stories set in this world scheduled in future "Sci-Fi" tokens.
