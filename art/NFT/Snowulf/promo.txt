The image is a black and white drawing of a wolf's head.
The wolf is facing the viewer with its mouth closed and its ears perked up.
The fur on the wolf's head is long and fluffy, and there is a patch of snow on its nose.
The background of the image is a winter forest.
The trees are bare, and the ground is covered in snow.
There is a mountain in the distance.

The image is drawn in a realistic style, and the artist has used shading to create depth and texture.
The wolf's fur is particularly well-rendered, and the artist has captured the animal's expression in great detail.
The background is also well-done, and the artist has used perspective to create a sense of distance.

The image is a good example of animal art, and it is sure to appeal to fans of wolves and wildlife.
It is also a technically proficient piece of art, and the artist has clearly put a lot of time and effort into creating it.

Author's Note:
I SWEAR, I didn't ask it, hint it, or anything to make it say it was good and took work.
Here's the prompt used for this description:

I need a very in-depth technical analysis of this image.
It's name is "Snowulf", and it's an NFT.
The description must be highly accurate, and can be as long as you desire as long as it is complete.
It must have enough details and granularity that non-vision models may glean just about any useful information there is from the image.

Anyway, yeah. Apparently either AI likes AI art, or Dall-E made a masterpiece again.
Either way, good night all! Happy New Year 2023-2024!!!
