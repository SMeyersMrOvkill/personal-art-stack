# Name - Desert Wanderer's Coin ( The Perl Collection #2 )

```
This name is magical because it evokes the image of a camel traveling through the desert, carrying a valuable coin.
The camel is a symbol of strength and endurance, and the coin is a symbol of wealth and prosperity.
Together, they represent the idea that the holder of the coin will be able to overcome any obstacle and achieve their goals.
The name is also appropriate because the token is a golden hexagonal coin with a black camel in the center.
The camel is facing to the right, which is the direction of travel. The coin is also surrounded by a hexagonal frame, which is a symbol of protection.
Overall, the name "Desert Wanderer's Coin" is a magical and appropriate name for the token.
It is a name that is both descriptive and evocative, and it captures the essence of the token's design and symbolism.

### Gemini Pro - Description

The image is a pixelated representation of a gold coin with a black camel in the center.
The camel is facing to the right and has red eyes.
The coin is surrounded by a hexagonal frame with six small circles on each side.
The surface of the coin is textured to appear as though it is made of metal.
The coin is in focus and appears to be well-lit.

### Gemini Pro - Differences From Prompt

The image differs from the prompt in a few ways.
The prompt specified a "golden hexagonal token coin," but the image is a round coin.
The prompt also specified that the camel should have "red eyes," but the camel in the image has black eyes.

## Author Commentary
Heh. Well, we got it out the door.
Seems my pixel art is a bit of a struggle for Gemini to see properly.
In any case, this was a fun set to generate. 
The whole, "trying to keep it PERL-SIMPLE" whilst attempting to make it pretty was actually a challenge.
In the end, I found the best results when I sliced 90% of my prompt off and just made a pile of images.
Not generally the best way to do things, but this collection proves it works some of the time.
